I'm going to assume that we only care about the bgpdump format of the file. So I'm going to assume that the 
mrt2bgpdump.py code is the only one that I care about. 

From this link: https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/internet-and-wan-monitoring/tests/bgp-tests/working-with-raw-bgp-data

I found that the output is in the following order: 
BGP Protocol
timestamp (in epoch format)
W/A/B (withdrawal/announcement/routing table)
Peer IP (address of the monitor)
Peer ASN (ASN of the monitor)
Prefix
ASPath
Origin Protocol (typically always IGP)
Next Hop

Because we only care about
	
	In this assignment, we will only focus on routes involving 208.65.152.0/22 AND all its sub-prefixes. 
	All questions refer to 208.65.152.0/22 AND all its sub-prefixes.

I will modify the code such that whenever we run it on a file, we focus only on the given values. So at lines
108 and 125, we ensure that '208.65.152' is part of the prefix and only then do we print out. This is because with 
the /22 we know that we only care about the most significant 22 bits so the first two segments and the 6 most sig bits
of the third segment. And in our case, 152 --> 10011000 and we only define the bits 100110 and leave the last two bits
as is. 

1. Observation from rib.20080224.1822

Here I believe are just multiple ASs advertising paths to the AS 36561 (Youtube) via the prefix
208.65.152.0/22. There are a ton of peer ASs here doing this advertising on behalf of Youtube. 
And all of them seem to be valid routes. 

1.1 AS 36561 is announcing prefix 208.65.152.0/22. 

1.2 If we lookup the AS via "whois.arin.net/rest/asn/AS36561" online, we find that it is a Youtube AS
and is the organization that owns it is Google LLC. 

1.3 If we do a whois terminal lookup on "208.65.152.0/22" we find that the prefix is owned by Youtube LLC.


2. Observation from updates.20080224.1839

We find that ASes are now advertising paths to the AS 17557 for the prefix 208.65.153.0/24. Because this
is subsumed by the prefix 208.65.152.0/22, addresses routed for 208.65.152.0/22 are instead routed to 
208.65.153.0/24, and the corresponding AS 17557, as it is more precise. All the prior ASes that were 
advertising paths to 36561 are now advertising paths to 17557. 

2.1 We find that the AS 17557 is announcing the prefix 208.65.153.0/24. 

2.2 The name of the organization that owns AS 17557 is Pakistan Telecommunication company limited. 

2.3 The AS that belongs to Pakistan Telecommunication (17557) company will receive the packets destined for 
IP address 208.65.153.0 because in binary the address translates to: 
11010000.01000001.10011001.00000000

which has a closer match to the prefix advertised by Pakistan Telecom: 
11010000.01000001.10011001.--------

rather than the prefix advertised by Youtube: 
11010000.01000001.100110--.--------

24 bits matched instead of 22 bits matched. 

2.4 The AS that belongs to Youtube/Google (36561) will receive the packets destined for
the IP address 208.65.152.0 because in binary the address translates to: 
11010000.01000001.10011000.00000000

which has a closer match to the prefix advertised by Youtube: 
11010000.01000001.100110--.--------

rather than the prefix advertised by Pakistan Telecom: 
11010000.01000001.10011001.--------

Because in the left-most bit of the third segment, the prefix advertised by Pakistan Telecom differs
from the IP address. But Youtube's prefix matches all specified bits (22). 

3. Observation from updates.20080224.1954

Here we see that Youtube's AS starts advertising a prefix that is as precise as the one advertised by 
Pakistan Telecom. This allows it to reclaim the traffic that was diverted to Pakistan Telecom's AS (17557). 
Interestingly all the paths that I can see in this file are all diverted through AS 3549 before getting
to AS 36561 (Youtube). 

3.1 Once again we find AS 36561 (Youtube) advertising 208.65.153.0/24. 

3.2 It depends on whichever AS the packet is on. Depending on the number of hops required for the packet
to be delivered to the prefix, different routings can occur. This is because The BGP protocol prefers
shorter paths and because both prefixes are idnetical, the only differentiating factor between the 
advertised paths is the length of the paths. AS long as the advertised path to AS 36561 (Youtube) is shorter than 
the advertised path to AS 17557 (Pakistan Telecom), Youtube will receive the packet. Otherwise, 
if the Pakistan Telecom path is shorter, then the Pakistan Telecom AS will receive the packet. 

3.3 I think that the AS made the announcement (the updated prefix) specified in this file so that partial
service availability could be restored. I think at this point Youtube realized that another AS was advertising
a more specific prefix than themselves and temporarily began to identify a prefix with the same specificity so that 
at least internet traffic generated closer locally (fewer AS hops) than from Pakistan Telecom would be routed properlyl. 
If users are not able to route their packets to the proper AS, I am going to assume that they would not be able to access Youtube. 
I am going to assume that Pakistan Telecom isn't impersonating Youtube, only intercepting and retaining Youtube's traffic. 

We can clearly see ASes switch over to shorter paths by observing AS 3356 in the prior file and the current file. 
Before, the AS path advertised had four nodes in the path but in the current file there are only 3 nodes in the path. 
This shows that ASes are actively monitoring path lengths and switching to shorter paths. I am assuming that ASes that observe
path lengths to prefixes that are equal to the paths they currently hold don't bother switching over to the new path (because
they are of the same length). Obviously its more complicated than that but close enough. 


4. Observation from updates.20080224.2009

Here we find that Youtube (AS 36561) announces a more precise prefix than the prefix it announced before
or even the prefix announced by Pakistan Telecom. Now it announces a prefix to 25 significant bits. 

4.1 AS 36561 (Youtube) annnounces two new prefixes 208.65.153.0/25 and 208.65.153.128/25. Basically
two identical addresses with a longer prefix that just have the least significant bit flipped. 

4.2 Now we are guaranteed to have AS 36561 (Youtube) receive the traffic destined for IP address 208.65.153.0
because one of the prefixes announced by the AS 36561 (Youtube) is: 

11010000.01000001.10011001.0-------

Which is a 25 bit match to the IP 208.65.153.0: 

11010000.01000001.10011001.00000000

which is greater than the 24 bit match to the address Pakistan Telecom can offer: 

11010000.01000001.10011001.--------

But in the case that a router does not acknowledge the /25 prefix length (something that I found after a google search)
then it is possible that it will default to routing based off of path length. 

4.3 The AS made the announcement that happens in this file because now it is guaranteed traffic pointed at 
the given address in a mode that is not dependent on the length of the AS path such as in Q3. But keep
in mind that this fix only works for routers that support a /25 prefix length. For routers that do not, 
the length-based routing will occur. We can see that not all routers support the /25 prefix length because not all 
of them switch over to advertising towards Youtube's AS. And this routing switches over because the /25 prefixes 
have both bits set so either address match will be routed towards the Youtube AS. 



5. Observation from rib.20080224.2024

We can see two conflicting advertised prefixes from two different ASes. One AS 36561 (Youtube) is advertising
208.65.152.0/22 and the other AS 17557 (Pakistan Telecom) is advertising prefix 208.65.153.0/24. But
what's really interesting about both of these is that the almost all the paths to AS 36561 are routed throguh 
AS 3549. While almost all the paths to 17557 are routed through 3491. 

It shows that Youtube has not been able to reclaim all of the AS advertisements via its /25 prefix advertisements
showing that some routers don't support the extended prefix lengths. 

5.1 I can see two unique ASes and prefix announcements. The first is AS 36561 (Youtube) announcing the 
208.65.152.0/22 the other is AS 17557 (Pakistan Telecom) which is announcing prefix 208.65.153.0/24. 

6. Observation from updates.20080224.2041

Here we see that upstream ASes (farther away from the destination) are manipulating the AS paths announced
by AS 17557 by appending a duplicate AS 17557 to the end of the path, artificially making it longer. 
This happens for AS neighbors announcing 17557 such as 5413 and 13237 but not for AS neighbors announcing
17557 such as 286. But this may just be a timing discrepancy. 

6.1 The AS path changed in the announcements. Originally it was 13237 3491 17557 for the first 3 announcements
but for the fourth one, it becomes 13237 3491 17557 17557. A duplicate 17557 was attached to the end of the path. 

6.2 I believe that the penultimate AS on the path effected this change (AS 3491) so that upstream ASes
would drop the 17557 path (due to its length) in favor of the real youtube path because the real youtube path is
a lot shorter.  

6.3 I can see that AS 5413 has a similar change in its AS path to 17557 (duplicated 17557 at the end). Also 
AS 7660 has a similar change in the path. Note that AS 5413 and 17557 both have 3491 on its path to 17557 so 
the path lengthening may be due to AS 3491. 


7. Observation from updates.20080224.2056

We can see that AS 13237 performs a Withdrawal of its original path to 17557 (Pakistan Telecom) for prefix 208.65.153.0/24 in favor
of a path to 36561 (Youtube). All other ASes are announcing paths to Youtube for the given prefix. 

7.1 Here are the announcements: 

U|A|1203886849.000000||13237|208.65.153.0/24|81.209.156.1|13237 3491 17557 17557|17557|
U|W|1203886881.000000||13237|208.65.153.0/24||||||
U|A|1203886882.000000||13237|208.65.153.0/24|81.209.156.1|13237 3549 36561|36561|
U|A|1203886882.000000||13237|208.65.153.0/24|81.209.156.1|13237 3549 36561|36561|

7.2 We can clearly see how AS 13237 drops that path to AS 17557 (due to its length) withdrawing it 
and advertises a shorter path for the same prefix to AS 36561 (Youtube). This would restore traffic to 
Youtube through AS 36561.
