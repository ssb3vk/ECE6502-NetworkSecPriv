There are two connections in this PCAP file. In both connections, a client connects to a server. Pick one connection and answer the following questions based on this connection.

1. List the packet numbers (column on the left in Wireshark) for the TCP three-way handshake of this connection.

The first set of three-way handshake's packet numbers are 1, 3, 5. 


2. What are the two IP addresses in this connection? What is the IP prefix/subnet and the owner (AS number) of each IP? 
(Hint: use whois). If you're unable to find such information on the IP from whois, what is the reason?

The two IP addresses are 192.168.1.15 and 128.143.67.11. 

For the first one, I couldn't get any information, I believe that it is a private IP address. But for the second one, I found that it is a UVA-based IP. 
The IP prefix/subnet is "/16" and the owner/AS number is UVA AS225. 


3. What is the client's port number? What is the server's port number? 

The client's port number is 56078, the server's port number is 443. 


4. What is the highest TLS version supported by the client? Please include the packet number.

TLS 1.2. As seen in packet number 7. 


5. Which ciphersuite does the server choose for the connection? Please include the packet number.

By inspecting the Server Hello, we can see that the server chose

"TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 (0xc02f)" cipher suite. This is detailed in packet 11. 


6. Choose a packet in this connection (after the TCP three-way handshake). 
Write down the packet number, and the Sequence number and Acknowledge number in this packet. 
Based on the Seq/Ack numbers, which IP has sent more data to the other IP? And Why?


The trivial way to do this is to count the number of times we see source as 192... and the number of times
we see dest as 128.... 

192...: 19
128...: 18

But that doesn't look right as we're just counting packets. 

But for the purpose of this problem, lets just look at the Seq/ACK values. 

By looking at packet 61, I think that the 128.143.67.11 IP sent more data than the other IP because
this packet is destined to 128.143.67.11 and has an ack of 13700 but a seq of only 3372. Indicating that 

128.143.67.11 --> 192.168.1.15 was about 13700 packets
192.168.1.15 --> 128.143.67.11 was about 3372 packets
